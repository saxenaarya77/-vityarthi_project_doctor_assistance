# 📄 Project Statement — Health Assistant Terminal

## 🔍 Problem Statement
People often search the internet for medical guidance when experiencing common symptoms such as *fever, cold, headache, or chest pain*.  
However, online information can be confusing, unreliable, and overwhelming.  
There is a need for a **quick and simple terminal-based tool** that gives:
- A basic understanding of common symptoms
- A possible diagnosis
- First-aid treatment suggestions
- Warning messages when the condition is severe

This project focuses on providing **beginner-level self-care hints**, not medical treatment.
