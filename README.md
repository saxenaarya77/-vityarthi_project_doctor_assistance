#  Health Assistant Terminal — Mini Medical Helper Bot
# Overview
Health Assistant Terminal is a beginner-friendly Python console project that simulates a simple **medical help chatbot**.  
A user can input a symptom (e.g., *fever, cold, headache, chest pain*), and the bot will display:
- Possible diagnosis
- Severity level
- Suggested treatment
- Medication / prevention tips (if available)
# Features
| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Symptom recognition | Detects common symptoms from user input |
| Simulated "AI" | Uses time and random to create fake loading bars and confidence percentages. |
| System Integration | Uses the os module to auto-clear the terminal screen on launch. |
| Condition analysis | Shows diagnosis, severity & treatment |
| Error-free lookup | Uses `.get()` to avoid crashes if data missing |
| Greeting response | Welcomes users if they say hello/hi |
| Exit command | Type `"Exit"` anytime to stop the bot |
